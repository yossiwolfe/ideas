# Home Object Finder & Highlighter

You lose stuff all of the time. It's time you've started finding things.

Cameras and a spotlight are added to the ceiling of every room in your home. The cameras are constantly paying attention to where you put things.
When you've lost something you simply ask the system where it is and it shines the spotlight on the exact area where the item last was.

Details coming soon...
