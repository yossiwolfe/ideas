# 🧠 Yossi Wolfe's Open-Source Idea Vault

A living archive of ideas I don’t have time to build — ranging from the wild to the practical. I believe ideas should be free - at least the ones that I'm not planning to implement right away. So please: steal them, remix them, evolve them, or collaborate.

Some are vague seeds. Some are structured blueprints. All are shared in the hope that they might help someone, somewhere, build something meaningful.
